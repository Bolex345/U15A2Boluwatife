        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <p>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester is a registered charity dedicated to preserving and promoting Slovak language and culture. We provide Slovak language education and organize cultural and community activities to help Slovak-speaking families maintain their heritage while living abroad.<p>

			<P>While our primary focus is on supporting Slovak-speaking children and families, we warmly welcome anyone interested in learning the Slovak language and engaging with our traditions. Beyond our Saturday school, we offer various workshops, events, and social activities where individuals of all ages can connect, learn, and take part in our cultural community.<p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
		 <div class="card">
            <p>Our mission is to ensure that children growing up abroad don’t lose their connection to their roots and to create a place where Slovak culture thrives, even far from home. We believe that language is more than just words; it carries identity, history, and a sense of belonging.<P>
			<p>We aim to bridge the gap between the UK and Slovak education systems, ensuring that children who may one day return to Slovakia can transition smoothly and supporting families navigating life between two countries.</p>
